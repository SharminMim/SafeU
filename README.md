# SafeU

A new Flutter project on Women Safety Security

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# Introduction:
The main goal of this project was to create a safety security app utilizing the Flutter UI framework for desktop, mobile, and online. Our project is intended to carry out basic security application functions. Anyone can receive assistance in an emergency circumstance with our safety security application. You can use the alert button to send a text, call or location in an emergency. You can simply get in touch with the police, fire department or any other government service you require with our app. In essence, it will provide women with the best service. We chose to create this application mainly due to their safety issue. It is extremely user-friendly and secure for everyone.

# Objective:
Because of a number of goals, we chose this project out of a vast array of options. But the following objectives are the most important ones for completing this project work:
  1. to carry out our first project within a new framework and take part in a project's execution as a member of the project team.
  2. Using Dart, create a project, work with object-oriented programming, and execute input/output data.
  3. To protect women's and children's safety
  4. To safeguard everyone from danger
  5. To promote designing knowledge as well as effective things skills
  6. Create a solid coding routine:
     1. Research more about coding for developing the application
     2. Learn the unknown part of coding for the project
     3. Use comments and appropriate indent during coding


# Motivation:
The project's motivations fall into two categories. The first step is to get ready for being developers. Making a project in Flutter is a wise choice for someone who wants to develop Android apps.
The second is to engage in practical problem-solving projects. Nowadays, everyone's safety is a major concern. The most prevalent issues in our culture are robbery, kidnapping, molestation, and murder. Someone suffers from one of them every day. We decided to make this app with that in mind so that he may save himself the time. In conclusion, the motivation was to start the mobile application development process by solving a practical issue.
